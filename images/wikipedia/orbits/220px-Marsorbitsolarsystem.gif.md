Description	
English: Mars’ average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million km (1.5 AU) and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days as depicted in the red trail when the Earth's blue trail orbit as reference

Kepler’s Third Law states that the square of the period T of any planet is proportional to the cube of the radius r of its orbit.

F_{{gravity}}=F_{{centripetal}}
G{\frac  {mM}{r^{2}}}\ ={\frac  {mv^{2}}{r}}\ 
G{\frac  {mM}{r^{2}}}\ =mr({\frac  {2\pi }{T}})^{2}
T^{2}={\frac  {4\pi ^{2}}{GM}}\ r^{3}
T^{2}\propto r^{3}
for example for Earth,

T^{2}={\frac  {4\pi ^{2}}{(6.67x10^{{-11}})(1.989x10^{{30}})}}(150x10^{9})^{3}
T=3.16x10^{7}seconds={\frac  {3.16x10^{7}}{(365)(24)(60)(60)}}year=1.00year
for example for Mars,

T^{2}={\frac  {4\pi ^{2}}{(6.67x10^{{-11}})(1.989x10^{{30}})}}(230x10^{9})^{3}
T=6.00x10^{7}seconds={\frac  {6.00x10^{7}}{(365)(24)(60)(60)}}year=1.90year

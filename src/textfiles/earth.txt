Earth has the largest moon respective to the planet's size. A molten core of iron produces a magnetic field that protects Earth's atmosphere otherwise the solar winds would strip it away over time and life wouldn't be able to on our planet. Life appeared on the surface within 1 billion years of forming. The planet is home to millions of species of life, including humans. Both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population. Estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to continue to support life range from 500 million years, up to 2.3 billion years.

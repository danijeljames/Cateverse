Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System. Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, yet is less dense than Earth. It has 67 natural moons, 4 which are referred to as Galilean moons (discovered in Jan 1610 by Galileo). Well known for it's Great Red Spot, a great anti-cyclonic (high pressure) storm akin to a hurricane on Earth, but it is enormous (three Earths would fit within its boundaries) and it has persisted for at least the 400 years that humans have observed it through telescopes. Having no physical surface, you would fall into the planet and eventually be crushed by pressure. It is theorised to have a core of liquid metallic Hydrogen.

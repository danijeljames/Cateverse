Roughly half the size of Earth, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere. Most notable for many years thought to have harboured life, Mars has now come to be the subject of NASA's Curiosity Rover exploration as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission. Olympic Mons (Mount Olympus), an extinct volcano roughly three times the eight of Mount Everest, is the tallest or second tallest mountain in the Solar System, depending on how it is measured. Various sources range it from 21 to 27 km high. Mars has two relatively small natural moons. Phobos (approx 22.5 km in diameter) and Deimos (about 13 km in diameter), which orbit close to the planet. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown.

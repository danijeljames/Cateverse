Known about since ancient Romand and Greek Times, Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is gravitationally locked making it unique in the Solar System. It rotates exactly 3 times for every 2 orbital periods. With an atmosphere being constantly blown away, Mercury is a barren wasteland much like the surface of the moon with extreme temperatures between day and night. It is theorised that Mercury might have ice at it's polar caps in craters that are deep enough. Having the smallest axle tilt of 1/30 of a degree, Mercury does not experience seasons like other planets do. Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System.

The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth and the fifth largest moon in the Solar System. It is the most luminous object in the sky after the Sun. Although it appears a very bright white, its surface is actually dark. After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited by only unmanned spacecraft. The Moon is under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes. The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The tides on Earth are mostly generated the Moon's gravitational pull from one side of Earth to the other, the tidal forces.

Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation.  Alexis Bouvard applied Newton's Laws of Gravity to the orbit of Uranus to deduce Neptune's existence. Neptune has been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. Neptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The internal structure of Neptune consists of 4 main zones. The upper atmosphere consisting of the top clouds. An atmosphere consisting of hydrogen, helium and methane gas. Mantle consisting of water, ammonia and methane ices. The core consists of rock (silicates and nickel–iron).

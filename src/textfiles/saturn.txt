Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol (♄) is a representation of the god's sickle. Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Predominantly composed of gas, it lacks a definite surface, although it may have a solid core. Saturn's rings were not known to exist until Galileo first saw them in 1610. They consist of countless particles, ranging from micrometers to metres. The ring particles are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material.

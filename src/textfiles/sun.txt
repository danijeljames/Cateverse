The Sun is the star at the centre of our Solar System. The distance from the Sun to the Earth is known as an astronomical unit (AU) and is approximately 150 million kilometers. AU is used to measure distances across our Solar System. It is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven magnetic fields. The Sun formed about 4.57 billion years ago from gravitational collapse of a region of a molecular cloud. The sun is about ¾ Hydrogen, while the rest is mostly Helium. The remainder (approximately 1.69%) consists of heavier elements, including Oxygen, Carbon, Neon and Iron, among others. In its core, the Sun fuses about 620 million metric tons of Hydrogen each second. The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse large area in a molecular cloud.

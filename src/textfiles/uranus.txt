Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, of different chemical composition than the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, astronomers sometimes place them in a separate category called "ice giants". Uranus is flipped on it's side ≈97.9° and its north and south poles are where most other planets have their equator. It is the coldest planet in the Solar System and has 21 year seasonal changes. The rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometers to a fraction of a meter. They did not form with Uranus and might be a moon that shattered by high-speed impacts. Uranus has 27 known moons. The names for these come from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.

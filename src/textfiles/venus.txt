The second brightest object in the night sky, Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, gravity, and bulk composition. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth's. Venus rotates on it's axis in retrograde, so the Sun rises in the West and sets in the East. The Soviet Venera 3 probe crash-landed on Venus on 1 March 1966 and was the first visit to this hostile world. The surface is ever changing as Venus is very volcanically active constantly changing the land.
